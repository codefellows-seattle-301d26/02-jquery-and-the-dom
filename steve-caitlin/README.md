# Project Name

**Author**: Caitlin Sweeney/ Steve Carpenter
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This is a blog application that generates articles based off of raw stored
data fields for each section of a blog article.

## Getting Started
In order to get the code up and running, you'll need to clone the repository
into a directory on your own machine. Once done, you will have to navigate
into the steve-caitlin directory and run live-server or open the index.html
file inside your browser. At this point, the JS code will build all the blog
articles and insert them into the HTML page you're viewing using jQuery.

## Architecture
This code utilizes the jQuery API, standard JS, and HTML. The CSS follows a
SMACSS approach of trying to create clear and concise styling by separating
the elements into files that make logical sense.

## Change Log
2017-12-07 8:40am - Updated the README and added in some additional styling
