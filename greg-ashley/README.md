# Project Name: 02 jQuery and the dom

**Greg and Ashley**:
**1.0.9**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?)

If I understand correct, the purpose of this exercise was to get us familiar with the concepts of using jQuery, and review valuable concepts from 201 such as object constructors.  First we had to build an object constructor using a dynamically generated object as it's argument. We then built the prototype function toHtml() to dynamically generate and render our array of hard coded objects(articles).  The last piece is to ensure that the articles get sorted from most recent to oldest article.-->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running?
1. build constructor function to house the data we need.
2. create a new prototype function to
  A. clone the template for how an object will be displayed.
  B. remove the template so no generic data is rendered to the DOM.
  C. Create a function to find the current date and sort it from newest to oldest.
  D. Loop through all the hard coded objects to instantiate our current object
  E. Loop through the objects and  render them to the page-->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information.
The languages we use our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  We utilize the jQuery library and our local images to render to the page-->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
12-06-17 10:00 - Built object constructer and cloned our template in HTML so we can fill that template with data.
12-06-17 10:30 - Added in all relevant CSS files.
12-06-17 10:45 - Created functionality to dynamically generate instantiated objects to render.
12-06-17 12:30 - Generates and renders appropriate data, project complete.

12-22-2017 2:30pm - Fixed errors, good to go.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Most of the credit goes to the best TA in the world, Michael Treat.  Otherwise we used https://oscarotero.com/jquery/ for a list of jQuery commands, and https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js for our jQuery src.
